1. What are the digital solutions that the industry have tried? To potentially prevent designing similar solutions 

1. Is there any other activities that depend on the current check-in/out system. In the case when solution replaces current check-in/out systems do we need to cater for these dependencies?

1. Can we run through the current check-in/out process?
