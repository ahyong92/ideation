## Question
1. Why does identification verification require "booking document + passport + credit card authorization"?

1. What are the "existing solutions and databases" that we need to integrate with as mentioned in Point 2 of "Possible Use Cases"?

1. As mentioned under "Context" that "hotels... have tried different digital check-in solutions to limited success", are you able to show us exactly what are some of the solutions that have been tried and in which aspects are they lacking? Having these references would help us to come up with a better solution.

1. Are there systems depending on the existing check-in/out system? If so, what are the API protocols used to communicate between these systems?

1. Can you run through with us the current check-in/out process? This will help us have a better understanding of the pain points experienced when using the existing solution.
